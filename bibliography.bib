abstract = {We analyze the impact of stratospheric volcanic aerosols on the diurnal temperature range (DTR) over Europe using long-term subdaily station records. We compare the results with a 28-member ensemble of European Centre/Hamburg version 5.4 (ECHAM5.4) general circulation model simulations. Eight stratospheric volcanic eruptions during the instrumental period are investigated. Seasonal all- and clear-sky DTR anomalies are compared with contemporary (approximately 20?year) reference periods. Clear sky is used to eliminate cloud effects and better estimate the signal from the direct radiative forcing of the volcanic aerosols. We do not find a consistent effect of stratospheric aerosols on all-sky DTR. For clear skies, we find average DTR anomalies of ?0.08�C (?0.13�C) in the observations (in the model), with the largest effect in the second winter after the eruption. Although the clear-sky DTR anomalies from different stations, volcanic eruptions, and seasons show heterogeneous signals in terms of order of magnitude and sign, the significantly negative DTR anomalies (e.g., after the Tambora eruption) are qualitatively consistent with other studies. Referencing with clear-sky DTR anomalies to the radiative forcing from stratospheric volcanic eruptions, we find the resulting sensitivity to be of the same order of magnitude as previously published estimates for tropospheric aerosols during the so-called ?global dimming? period (i.e., 1950s to 1980s). Analyzing cloud cover changes after volcanic eruptions reveals an increase in clear-sky days in both data sets. Quantifying the impact of stratospheric volcanic eruptions on clear-sky DTR over Europe provides valuable information for the study of the radiative effect of stratospheric aerosols and for geo-engineering purposes.},

@article{Barnston1993,
abstract = {Abstract Highly negative skill scores may occur in regression-based experimental forecast trials in which the data being forecast are withheld in turn from a fixed sample, and the remaining data are used to develop regression relationships-that is, exhaustive cross-validation methods. A small negative bias in skill is amplified when forecasts are verified using the correlation between forecasts and actual data. The same outcome occurs when forecasts are amplitude-inflated in conversion to a categorical system and scored in a ?number of hits? framework. The effect becomes severe when predictor-predictand relationships are weak, as is often the case in climate prediction. Some basic characteristics of this degeneracy are explored for regression-based cross-validation. Simulations using both randomized and designed datasets indicate that the correlation skill score degeneracy becomes important when nearly all of the available sample is used to develop forecast equations for the remaining (very few) points, and when the predictability in the full dependent sample falls short of the conventional requirement for statistical significance for the sample size. The undesirable effects can be reduced with one of the following methodological adjustments: 1) excluding more than a very small portion of the sample from the development group for each cross-validation forecast trial or 2) redefining the ?total available sample? within one cross-validation exercise. A more complete elimination of the effects is achieved by 1) downward adjusting the magnitude of negative correlation skills in proportion to forecast amplitude, 2) regarding negative correlation skills as zero, or 3) using a forecast verification measure other than correlation such as root-mean-square error. When the correlation skill score degeneracy is acknowledged and treated appropriately, cross-validation remains an effective and valid technique for estimating predictive skill for independent data.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

A comprehensive assessment of climate model performance at the grid box scale in simulating recent change, however, is not available at present. Therefore, we compare observed changes in near-surface temperature, sea level pressure (SLP) and precipitation with simulations available from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects 3 and 5 (CMIP3 and CMIP5). In both multi-model datasets we find coherent areas of inconsistency between observed and simulated local trends per degree global warming in both temperature and SLP in themajority of models. Localised projections should thus take into account the possibility of regional biases shared across models. In contrast, simulated changes in precipitation are not significantly different from observations due to low signal-to-noise ratio of local precipitation changes. Therefore, recent regional rainfall change is likely not providing useful constraints for future projections as of yet. Comparing the two most recent sets of internationally coordinated climate model experiments, we find no indication of improvement in the models’ ability to reproduce local trends in temperature, SLP and precipitation.},

abstract = {Abstract{\&}nbsp;{\&}nbsp;Often it is claimed that the recent changes in northern European climate are at least partly anthropogenic even though a human influence has not yet been successfully detected. Hence we investigate whether the recent changes are consistent with regional climate change projections. Therefore, trends in winter (DJF) mean precipitation in northern Europe are compared to human induced changes as predicted by a set of four regional climate model simulations. The patterns of recent trends and predicted changes match reasonably well as indicated by pattern correlation and the similarity is very likely not random. However, the model projections generally underestimate the recent change in winter precipitation. That is, the signal-to-noise ratio of the anthropogenic precipitation change is either rather low or the presently used simulations are significantly flawed in their ability to project changes into the future. European trends contain large signals related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), of which a major unknown part may be unrelated to the anthropogenic signal. Therefore, we also examine the consistency of recent and projected changes after subtracting the NAO signal in both the observations and in the projections. It turns out that even after the removal of the NAO signal, the pattern of trends in the observations is similar to those projected by the models. At the same time, the magnitude of the trends is considerably reduced and closer to the magnitude of the change in the projections},

abstract = {We present a vertically resolved zonal mean monthly mean global ozone data set spanning the period 1901 to 2007, called HISTOZ.1.0. It is based on a new approach that combines information from an ensemble of chemistry climate model (CCM) simulations with historical total column ozone information. The CCM simulations incorporate important external drivers of stratospheric chemistry and dynamics (in particular solar and volcanic effects, greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, sea surface temperatures, and the quasi-biennial oscillation). The historical total column ozone observations include ground-based measurements from the 1920s onward and satellite observations from 1970 to 1976. An off-line data assimilation approach is used to combine model simulations, observations, and information on the observation error. The period starting in 1979 was used for validation with existing ozone data sets and therefore only ground-based measurements were assimilated. Results demonstrate considerable skill from the CCM simulations alone. Assimilating observations provides additional skill for total column ozone. With respect to the vertical ozone distribution, assimilating observations increases on average the correlation with a reference data set, but does not decrease the mean squared error. Analyses of HISTOZ.1.0 with respect to the effects of El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and of the 11 yr solar cycle on stratospheric ozone from 1934 to 1979 qualitatively confirm previous studies that focussed on the post-1979 period. The ENSO signature exhibits a much clearer imprint of a change in strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation compared to the post-1979 period. The imprint of the 11 yr solar cycle is slightly weaker in the earlier period. Furthermore, the total column ozone increase from the 1950s to around 1970 at northern mid-latitudes is briefly discussed. Indications for contributions of a tropospheric ozone increase, greenhouse gases, and changes in atmospheric circulation are found. Finally, the paper points at several possible future improvements of HISTOZ.1.0.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Gillett2015,
abstract = {Projected climate change integrates the net response to multiple climate feedbacks. Whereas existing long-term climate change projections are typically based on unweighted individual climate model simulations, as observed climate change intensifies it is increasingly becoming possible to constrain the net response to feedbacks and hence projected warming directly from observed climate change. One approach scales simulated future warming based on a fit to observations over the historical period, but this approach is only accurate for near-term projections and for scenarios of continuously increasing radiative forcing. For this reason, the recent Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) included such observationally constrained projections in its assessment of warming to 2035, but used raw model projections of longer term warming to 2100. Here a simple approach to weighting model projections based on an observational constraint is proposed which does not assume a linear relationship between past and future changes. This approach is used to weight model projections of warming in 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 forcing scenario, based on an observationally constrained estimate of the Transient Climate Response derived from a detection and attribution analysis. The resulting observationally constrained 5-95{\%} warming range of 0.8-2.5 K is somewhat lower than the unweighted range of 1.1-2.6 K reported in the IPCC AR5.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach allowing for systematic causal attribution of weather and climate-related events, in near-real time. The method is purposely designed to facilitate its implementation at meteorological centers by relying on data treatments that are routinely performed when numerically forecasting the weather. Namely, we show that causal attribution can be obtained as a by-product of so-called data assimilation procedures that are run on a daily basis to update the meteorological model with new atmospheric observations; hence, the proposed methodology can take advantage of the powerful computational and observational capacity of weather forecasting centers. We explain the theoretical rationale of this approach and sketch the most prominent features of a "data assimilation-based detection and attribution" (DADA) procedure. The proposal is illustrated in the context of the classical three-variable Lorenz model with additional forcing. Several theoretical and practical research questions that need to be addressed to make the proposal readily operational within weather forecasting centers are finally laid out.},

@article{JanvanOldenborgh2005,
abstract = {Since 1997, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has made seasonal forecasts with ensembles of a coupled ocean-atmosphere model, System-1 (S1). In January 2002, a new version, System-2 (S2), was introduced. For the calibration of these models, hindcasts have been performed starting in 1987, so that 15 yr of hindcasts and forecasts are now available for verification. The main cause of seasonal predictability is El Nino and La Nina perturbing the average weather in many regions and seasons throughout the world. As a baseline to compare the dynamical models with, a set of simple statistical models (STAT) is constructed. These are based on persistence and a lagged regression with the first few EOFs of SST from 1901 to 1986 wherever the correlations ate significant. The first EOF corresponds to ENSO, and the second corresponds to decadal ENSO. The temperature model uses one EOF, the sea level pressure (SLP) model uses five EOFs, and the precipitation model uses two EOFs but excludes persistence. As the number of verification data points is very low (15), the simplest measure of skill is used: the correlation coefficient of the ensemble mean. To further reduce the sampling uncertainties, we restrict ourselves to areas and seasons of known ENSO teleconnections. The dynamical ECMWT models show better skill in 2-m temperature forecasts over sea and the tropical land areas than STAT, but the modeled ENSO teleconnection pattern to North America is shifted relative to observations, leading to little pointwise skill. Precipitation forecasts of the ECMWF models are very good, better than those of the statistical model, in southeast Asia, the equatorial Pacific, and the Americas in December-February. In March-May the skill is lower. Overall, S1 (S2) shows better skill than STAT at lead time of 2 months in 29 (32) out of 40 regions and seasons of known ENSO teleconnections.},

@article{Kalnay1998,
abstract = {Abstract In 1939 Rossby demonstrated the usefulness of the linearized perturbation of the equations of motion for weather prediction and thus made possible the first successful numerical forecasts of the weather by Charney et al. In 1951 Charney wrote a paper on the science of numerical weather prediction (NWP), where he predicted with remarkable vision how NWP would evolve until the present. In the 1960's Lorenz discovered that the chaotic nature of the atmosphere imposes a finite limit of about two weeks to weather predictability. At that time this fundamental discovery was ?only of academic interest? and not really relevant to operational weather forecasting, since at that time the accuracy of even a 2-day forecast was rather poor. Since then, however, computer-based forecasts have improved so much that Lorenz's limit of predictability is starting to become attainable in practice, especially with ensemble forecasting, and the predictabilty of longer-lasting phenomena such as El Ni{\~{n}}o is beginning to be successfully exploited. The skill of operational weather forecasts has at least doubled over the last two decades. This improvement has taken place relatively steadily, driven by a large number of scientific and computational developments, especially in the area of NWP. It has taken place in all the operational NWP centers, as friendly competition and information sharing make scientific improvements take place faster than they would in a single center. Because the improvements have occurred steadily, rather than suddenly, the overall increase in forecast skill due to NWP has not been clearly recognized by the media and the public despite the impact that improved forecasts have on the national economy and on the lives of every American. In this paper the authors review several measures of operational forecast skill that quantify improvements in NWP at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP, formerly the National Meteorological Center) of the National Weather Service, although they are representative of improvements in all major NWP operational centers. The authors point out that there are three major requirements for improved numerical weather prediction: better atmospheric models, better observational data, and better methods for data assimilation. These improvements are generally very computer intensive and can only be made operational with the availability of more powerful supercomputers. Operational forecasts are compared with ?refor{\ldots}},

abstract = {Climate science poses an interesting yet challenging field of application for state-of-the-art statistical methodology, since atmospheric phenom- ena include a wide range of scales spanning from microscopic (e.g. ice nucleation in clouds) to global (e.g. the Hadley Circulation) scales and exhibit complex interactions. A cornerstone in the assessment of the climate state are comprehensive computer models. Although these models are deterministic, it is natu- ral to interpret their output from a statistical view point. This is due to the stochastic nature of the climate system including a large number of degrees of freedom and non-linear or chaotic behavior on different scales. Analyzing climate model output is challenging for manifold rea- sons: the enormous amount of data produced by typical climate models, the complex dependencies between different output fields and models, the long time scales that hamper validation etc. This thesis develops statistical methods to analyze climate data and thereby tackles an important issue in climate research, namely the choice of bias assumption in the post-processing of climate data. Bi- ases or errors in climate models occur for various reasons: numerical uncertainties and mistakes in the computer code, missing processes, pa- rameterizations of phenomena acting on scales smaller than the model’s grid resolution and so on. Comparing models with observations in the past and present, these biases become evident. The output from cli- mate models is thus only a “contaminated” version of reality, and be- cause future observations are not available, extrapolation assumptions for climate model biases are indispensable to estimate true changes. This thesis investigates prominent bias assumptions and analyzes their x Abstract validity under climate change. We use 2m temperatures from the EU ENSEMBLES project – a large climate change research initiative for Europe – and study the driving global climate models (GCMs) as well as their high-resolution regional counterparts (RCMs). Contrary to the well-established belief that bias changes are negligible compared to climate change, our analyses suggest that these changes are significant. It is therefore advisable to allow for time-dependent biases. Additionally, we find that although relations between RCMs and their driving GCM are strong and in principle linear, RCMs reduce biases of their drivers. In agreement with these findings, we have developed a Bayesian hier- archical model that allows a coherent and holistic analysis of heteroge- neous RCM-GCM multi-model ensembles. All relevant assumptions on which our statistical model rests upon are transparently set out. Our approach is superior to alternative statistical modeling proposals due to its flexible functional form that allows for multidecadal variability and enables an integral analysis of climate time series. Our results have also implications for the design of prospective RCM-GCM multi- model ensembles, namely, independent RCM-GCM chains are a key to maximizing predictive power. Methods developed in this thesis are neither constrained to specific data sets nor certain climate variables but are generic and transferable.},

abstract = {Abstract The expected value for various measures of skill for seasonal climate predictions is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio. The expected value, however, is only realized for long verification time series. In practice, the verifications for specific seasons?for example, forecasts for the December?February seasonal mean?seldom exceed a sample size of 30. The estimates of skill measure based on small verification time series, because of sampling errors, can have large departures from their expected value. An analysis of spread in the estimates of skill measures with the length of verification time series and for different signal-to-noise ratios is made. The analysis is based on the Monte Carlo approach and skill measures for deterministic, categorical, and probabilistic forecasts are considered. It is shown that the behavior of spread for various skill measures can be very different and it is not always the largest for the small values of signal-to-noise ratios.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

@article{Mahlstein2010,
abstract = {Climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse emissions leads to impacts on a global and a regional scale. A quantitative picture of the projected changes on a regional scale can help to decide on appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. In the past, regional climate change results have often been presented on rectangular areas. But climate is not bound to a rectangular shape and each climate variable shows a distinct pattern of change. Therefore, the regions over which the simulated climate change results are aggregated should be based on the variable(s) of interest, on current mean climate as well as on the projected future changes. A cluster analysis algorithm is used here to define regions encompassing a similar mean climate and similar projected changes. The number and the size of the regions depend on the variable(s) of interest, the local climate pattern and on the uncertainty introduced by model disagreement. The new regions defined by the cluster analysis algorithm include information about regional climatic features which can be of a rather small scale. Comparing the regions used so far for large scale regional climate change studies and the new regions it can be shown that the spacial uncertainty of the projected changes of different climate variables is reduced significantly, i.e. both the mean climate and the expected changes are more consistent within one region and therefore more representative for local impacts.},

}
@techreport{Molteni2011a,
abstract = {ECMWF will introduce a new seasonal forecast system (System 4) in November 2011 (*), following a line of research and development in extended-range predictions which has spanned almost three decades. The new system is expected to provide advances in the quality of forecast products, feed back onto the ECMWF core activities in terms of atmospheric model diagnostics and ocean modelling/analysis tools, allowing ECMWF to maintain a position of excellence in international programmes and activities on long-range forecasting. This paper illustrates the main methodologies and modelling configurations adopted in the new system, and presents a preliminary assessment of the system performance. The paper is broadly divided into three parts. The first part describes the configuration of the coupled model, ocean analysis system, and re-forecast set, illustrating the main areas of progress with respect to the current seasonal system (System 3). The second part of the paper deals with “core” results on the coupled model biases and forecast scores for SST and atmospheric variables. It is shown that System 4 delivers improved predictive skill for a majority of parameters and regions, with the additional advantage of a better match between ensemble-mean errors and ensemble spread and therefore increased reliability. This occurs in spite of a cold bias in the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, which originates from too strong trade winds simulated by the ECMWF atmospheric model in the central and western Pacific. The third part discusses some aspects of System 4 configuration and forecast skill which are worth a more detailed analysis. These include the configuration and scientific results from the new ocean re-analysis (ORA-S4), an assessment of predictive skill for large-scale rainfall anomalies and tropical storm properties, and results of experimentation with momentum flux correction aimed at investigating the impact of IFS tropical wind biases on the coupled system. In summary, the preliminary assessment of System 4 presented in this paper indicates that System 4 is able to deliver on all major goals that a state-of-the-art seasonal forecast system is expected to attain.

abstract = {Animal-available pasture biomass has been observed and recorded for the past few decades to assess the crucial impact of pasture conditions on pastoral livestock husbandry, which is one of the major industries in Mongolia. This database provided a unique, useful basis for the present correlation analysis between seasonal measures of meteorological variables and pasture yield at three sites in southern Mongolia. Precipitation in July exhibited a high correlation with pasture yield, whereas high temperatures in June and July demonstrated a considerable negative correlation. Consequently, a reduction in precipitation with an increase in high temperature results in a lower yield, whereas sufficient precipitation with a reduction in high temperature results in greater production. The study also attempted to establish a new aridity index. The pasture yield correlated closely with the new aridity index. This implies that aridity has the potential to restrain grass growth in Mongolia.},

abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts are becoming more and more available. How should they be used and communicated? What are the obstacles to their use in practice? I review experience with five problems where probabilistic forecasting played an important role. This leads me to identify five types of potential users: Low Stakes Users, who don't need probabilistic forecasts; General Assessors, who need an overall idea of the uncertainty in the forecast; Change Assessors, who need to know if a change is out of line with expectatations; Risk Avoiders, who wish to limit the risk of an adverse outcome; and Decision Theorists, who quantify their loss function and perform the decision-theoretic calculations. This suggests that it is important to interact with users and to consider their goals. The cognitive research tells us that calibration is important for trust in probability forecasts, and that it is important to match the verbal expression with the task. The cognitive load should be minimized, reducing the probabilistic forecast to a single percentile if appropriate. Probabilities of adverse events and percentiles of the predictive distribution of quantities of interest seem often to be the best way to summarize probabilistic forecasts. Formal decision theory has an important role, but in a limited range of applications.},

abstract = {Critical decisions frequently rely on high-dimensional output from complex computer simulation models that show intricate cross-variable, spatial and temporal dependence structures, with weather and climate predictions being key examples. There is a strongly increasing recognition of the need for uncertainty quantification in such settings, for which we propose and review a general multi-stage procedure called ensemble copula coupling (ECC), proceeding as follows: 1. Generate a raw ensemble, consisting of multiple runs of the computer model that differ in the inputs or model parameters in suitable ways. 2. Apply statistical postprocessing techniques, such as Bayesian model averaging or nonhomogeneous regression, to correct for systematic errors in the raw ensemble, to obtain calibrated and sharp predictive distributions for each univariate output variable individually. 3. Draw a sample from each postprocessed predictive distribution. 4. Rearrange the sampled values in the rank order structure of the raw ensemble to obtain the ECC postprocessed ensemble. The use of ensembles and statistical postprocessing have become routine in weather forecasting over the past decade. We show that seemingly unrelated, recent advances can be interpreted, fused and consolidated within the framework of ECC, the common thread being the adoption of the empirical copula of the raw ensemble. Depending on the use of Quantiles, Random draws or Transformations at the sampling stage, we distinguish the ECC-Q, ECC-R and ECC-T variants, respectively. We also describe relations to the Schaake shuffle and extant copula-based techniques. In a case study, the ECC approach is applied to predictions of temperature, pressure, precipitation and wind over Germany, based on the 50-member European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble.},

abstract = {Ensemble forecasts of weather and climate are subject to systematic biases in the ensemble mean and variance, leading to inaccurate estimates of the forecast mean and variance. To address these biases, ensemble forecasts are often post-processed using statistical recalibration frameworks. These frameworks specify parametric probability distributions for the verifying observations. The forecast is often assumed to follow a Normal distribution with mean and variance specified by linear functions of the ensemble mean and variance. The parameters of the recalibration framework are estimated from historical archives of forecasts and verifying observations. Often there are relatively few forecasts and observations available for parameter estimation, and so the fitted parameters are also subject to uncertainty. This artefact is usually ignored. This study reviews analytic results that account for parameter uncertainty in the widely used Model Output Statistics recalibration framework. A simple method is proposed based on bootstrap resampling that leads to an approximation of the parameter uncertainty in more general frameworks such as Non-homogeneous Gaussian Regression. Forecasts on daily, seasonal and annual time scales are used to demonstrate that accounting for parameter uncertainty in the recalibrated predictive distributions leads to probability forecasts that are more skilful and reliable than those in which parameter uncertainty is ignored. The improvements are attributed to more reliable tail probabilities of the recalibrated forecast distributions.},

abstract = {Abstract Recurring droughts and decreased agricultural productivity during the last two decades in West Africa point to the need for a clearer understanding of the length of dry spells, their frequencies and their probabilities. The simplest calculations of dry spells for general applications involve computation of the probabilities of maximum and conditional dry spells exceeding a user-specified threshold value from a given calendar date. For more precise applications in agriculture, it is important to consider the different periods after sowing a crop, since sowing dates in the semiarid West African regions vary from year to year. Using the specific definition of onset of rains in each year as the sowing date, the length of dry cells was calculated from the historical rainfall data. Probability distribution of time to the next wet day and the percentage frequencies of dry spells were computed for successive days after sowing (DAS) a crop. Dry-spell analysis showed a pronounced drop in the drought risk for cereal crops from the panicle initiation phase (20 DAS) to the following phase (60 DAS). The relationships between mean annual rainfall and average frequency of dry spells for the selected locations in West Africa showed distinct patterns and permit the prediction of the frequency of dry spells from annual rainfall totals. Applications of the dry-spell analysis for the choice of a crop/variety, supplements irrigation, and crop water requirements have been described with examples.},

Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities. Nonetheless, communicating deeper uncertainties resulting from incomplete or disputed knowledge--or from essential indeterminacy about the future--remains a challenge.},

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fourth assessment report, published in 2007 came to a more confident assessment of the causes of global temperature change than previous reports and concluded that ‘it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except Antarctica.’ Since then, warming over Antarctica has also been attributed to human influence, and further evidence has accumulated attributing a much wider range of climate changes to human activities. Such changes are broadly consistent with theoretical understanding, and climate model simulations, of how the planet is expected to respond. This paper reviews this evidence from a regional perspective to reflect a growing interest in understanding the regional effects of climate change, which can differ markedly across the globe. We set out the methodological basis for detection and attribution and discuss the spatial scales on which it is possible to make robust attribution statements. We review the evidence showing significant human-induced changes in regional temperatures, and for the effects of external forcings on changes in the hydrological cycle, the cryosphere, circulation changes, oceanic changes, and changes in extremes. We then discuss future challenges for the science of attribution. To better assess the pace of change, and to understand more about the regional changes to which societies need to adapt, we will need to refine our understanding of the effects of external forcing and internal variability.

abstract = {Abstract Spatially and temporally dependent fingerprint patterns of near-surface temperature change are derived from transient climate simulations of the second Hadley Centre coupled ocean?atmosphere GCM (HADCM2). Trends in near-surface temperature are calculated from simulations in which HADCM2 is forced with historical increases in greenhouse gases only and with both greenhouse gases and anthropogenic sulfur emissions. For each response an ensemble of four simulations is carried out. An estimate of the natural internal variability of the ocean?atmosphere system is taken from a long multicentury control run of HADCM2. The aim of the study is to investigate the spatial and temporal scales on which it is possible to detect a significant change in climate. Temporal scales are determined by taking temperature trends over 10, 30, and 50 yr using annual mean data, and spatial scales are defined by projecting these trends onto spherical harmonics. Each fingerprint pattern is projected onto the recent observed pattern to give a scalar detection variable. This is compared with the distribution expected from natural variability, estimated by projecting the fingerprint pattern onto a distribution of patterns taken from the control run. Detection is claimed if the detection variable is greater than the 95th percentile of the distribution expected from natural variability. The results show that climate change can be detected on the global mean scale for 30- and 50-yr trends but not for 10-yr trends, assuming that the model?s estimate of variability is correct. At subglobal scales, climate change can be detected only for 50-yr trends and only for large spatial scales (greater than 5000 km). Patterns of near-surface temperature trends for the 50 yr up to 1995 from the simulation that includes only greenhouse gas forcing are inconsistent with the observed patterns at small spatial scales (less than 2000 km). In contrast, patterns of temperature trends for the simulation that includes both greenhouse gas and sulfate forcing are consistent with the observed patterns at all spatial scales. The possible limits to future detectability are investigated by taking one member of each ensemble to represent the observations and other members of the ensemble to represent model realizations of future temperature trends. The results show that for trends to 1995 the probability of detection is greatest at spatial scales greater than 5000 km. As the future signal of climate change be{\ldots}},

Particularly, their decompositions into measures quantifying the reliability, resolution, and uncertainty of the forecasts are attractive. Information theory sets up the natural framework for forecast verification. Recently, it has been shown that the BS is a second-order approximation of the information-based ignorance score (IGN), which also contains easily interpretable components and can also be generalized to a ranked version (RIGN). Here, the IGN, its generalizations, and decompositions are systematically discussed in analogy to the variants of the BS. Additionally, a continuous ranked IGN (CRIGN) is introduced in analogy to the CRPS. The appli- cability and usefulness of the conceptually appealing CRIGN are illustrated, together with an algorithm to evaluate its components reliability, resolution, and uncertainty for ensemble-generated forecasts.},

abstract = {The analysis of climatological data often involves statistical significance testing at many locations. While the field significance approach determines if a field as a whole is significant, a multiple testing procedure determines which particular tests are significant. Many such procedures are available, most of which control, for every test, the probability of detecting significance that does not really exist. The aim of this paper is to introduce the novel ‘‘false discovery rate’’ approach, which controls the false rejections in a more meaningful way. Specifically, it controls a priori the expected proportion of falsely rejected tests out of all rejected tests; additionally, the test results are more easily interpretable. The paper also investigates the best way to apply a false discovery rate (FDR) approach to spatially correlated data, which are common in climatology. The most straightforward method for controlling the FDR makes an assumption of independence between tests, while other FDR-controlling methods make less stringent assumptions. In a simulation study involving data with correlation structure similar to that of a real climatological dataset, the simple FDR method does control the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses despite the violation of assumptions, while a more complicated method involves more computation with little gain in detecting alternative hypotheses. A very general method that makes no assumptions controls the proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses but at the cost of detecting few alternative hypotheses. Despite its unrealistic assumption, based on the simulation results, the authors suggest the use of the straightforward FDRcontrolling method and provide a simple modification that increases the power to detect alternative hypotheses.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Climate is a key consideration for winegrowers, so information regarding projected climate change and the relative global impacts are of great interest. Methods and Results This climate analogue approach compares and contrasts future to current climate among the regions. Warming was projected for all regions, with greater warming in Northern Hemisphere continental regions and less for Southern Hemisphere and coastal regions. Projections of annual precipitation varied, with the median result from the range of models indicating a wetter climate for higher latitude regions, such as New Zealand, Mosel Valley and North Oregon, and the Chinese region in this study, while Southern European, Australian and South African winegrowing regions had a projected drier climate. The median model result for winter precipitation indicated a projected decrease for sites in Chile, Greece, Australia and Spain, with other European and American sites experiencing a slight increase in winter precipitation. Shandong, China, was the only region in this study projected to experience increased summer precipitation. Conclusion Future temperature and precipitation projections were made for 23 winegrowing regions worldwide and compared using a climate analogue approach. Significance of the Study An estimated future temperature and precipitation climatology centred on 2030 and 2070 for 23 winegrowing regions worldwide is made using results from 23 global climate models. Using these climatologies, along with consideration of length of the planning horizon, legal limitations and inter-regional climate variability, climate analogues can be described. For future planning, winegrape cultivars better suited to the projected climate may then be selected from the range currently growing in identified analogue regions. Alternatively, climatically optimum sites can be identified for growing particular cultivars in future conditions.},

abstract = {he influence of a warming climate on the occurrence of severe thunderstorm environments in Australia was explored using two global climate models: CCAM and CSIRO Mk3.6. These models have previously been evaluated and found to be capable of reproducing a useful climatology for the 20th century period (1980 to 2000). Analyzing the changes between the historical period and high warming climate scenarios for the period 2079 to 2099 has allowed estimation of the potential convective future for the continent. Based on these simulations, significant increases to the frequency of severe thunderstorm environments will likely occur for northern and eastern Australia in a warmed climate. This change is a response to increasing convective available potential energy from higher continental moisture, particularly in proximity to warm sea-surface temperatures. Despite decreases to the frequency of environments with high vertical wind shear, it appears unlikely that this will offset increases to thermodynamic energy. The change is most pronounced during the peak of the convective season, increasing its length and the frequency of severe thunderstorm environments therein, particularly over the eastern parts of the continent. The implications of this potential increase are significant, with the overall frequency of potential severe thunderstorm days per year likely to rise over the major population centers of the east coast by 14 percent for Brisbane, 22 percent for Melbourne and 30 percent for Sydney. The limitations of this approach are then discussed in the context of ways to increase the confidence of predictions of future severe convection.},

@article{Weigel2008a,
abstract = {Abstract Monthly forecasting bridges the gap between medium-range weather forecasting and seasonal predictions. While such forecasts in the prediction range of 1?4 weeks are vital to many applications in the context of weather and climate risk management, surprisingly little has been published on the actual monthly prediction skill of existing global circulation models. Since 2004, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts has operationally run a dynamical monthly forecasting system (MOFC). It is the aim of this study to provide a systematic and fully probabilistic evaluation of MOFC prediction skill for weekly averaged forecasts of surface temperature in dependence of lead time, region, and season. This requires the careful setup of an appropriate verification context, given that the verification period is short and ensemble sizes small. This study considers the annual cycle of operational temperature forecasts issued in 2006, as well as the corresponding 12 yr of reforecasts (hindcasts). The debiased ranked probability skill score (RPSSD) is applied for verification. This probabilistic skill metric has the advantage of being insensitive to the intrinsic unreliability due to small ensemble sizes?an issue that is relevant in the present context since MOFC hindcasts only have five ensemble members. The formulation of the RPSSD is generalized here such that the small hindcast ensembles and the large operational forecast ensembles can be jointly considered in the verification. A bootstrap method is applied to estimate confidence intervals. The results show that (i) MOFC forecasts are generally not worse than climatology and do outperform persistence, (ii) MOFC forecasts are skillful beyond a lead time of 18 days over some ocean regions and to a small degree also over tropical South America and Africa, (iii) extratropical continental predictability essentially vanishes after 18 days of integration, and (iv) even when the average predictability is low there can nevertheless be climatic conditions under which the forecasts contain useful information. With the present model, a significant skill improvement beyond 18 days of integration can only be achieved by increasing the averaging interval. Recalibration methods are expected to be without effect since the forecasts are essentially reliable.},

abstract = {Seasonal climate forecasts are being used increasingly across a range of application sectors. A recent UK governmental report asked: how good are seasonal forecasts on a scale of 1–5 (where 5 is very good), and how good can we expect them to be in 30 years time? Seasonal forecasts are made from ensembles of integrations of numerical models of climate. We argue that ‘goodness’ should be assessed first and foremost in terms of the probabilistic reliability of these ensemble-based forecasts; reliable inputs are essential for any forecast-based decision-making. We propose that a ‘5’ should be reserved for systems that are not only reliable overall, but where, in particular, small ensemble spread is a reliable indicator of low ensemble forecast error. We study the reliability of regional temperature and precipitation forecasts of the current operational seasonal forecast system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, universally regarded as one of the world-leading operational institutes producing seasonal climate forecasts. A wide range of ‘goodness’ rankings, depending on region and variable (with summer forecasts of rainfall over Northern Europe performing exceptionally poorly) is found. Finally, we discuss the prospects of reaching ‘5’ across all regions and variables in 30 years time.},

abstract = {Although regional climate models (RCMs) are powerful tools for describing regional and even smaller scale climate conditions, they still feature severe systematic errors. In order to provide optimized climate scenarios for climate change impact research, this study merges linear and nonlinear empirical-statistical downscaling techniques with bias correction methods and investigates their ability for reducing RCM error characteristics. An ensemble of seven empirical-statistical downscaling and error correction methods (DECMs) is applied to post-process daily precipitation sums of a high-resolution regional climate hindcast simulation over the Alpine region, their error characteristics are analysed and compared to the raw RCM results. Drastic reductions in error characteristics due to application of DECMs are demonstrated. Direct point-wise methods like quantile mapping and local intensity scaling as well as indirect spatial methods as nonlinear analogue methods yield systematic improvements in median, variance, frequency, intensity and extremes of daily precipitation. Multiple linear regression methods, even if optimized by predictor selection, transformation and randomization, exhibit significant shortcomings for modelling daily precipitation due to their linear framework. Comparing the well-performing methods to each other, quantile mapping shows the best performance, particularly at high quantiles, which is advantageous for applications related to extreme precipitation events. The improvements are obtained regardless of season and region, which indicates the potential transferability of these methods to other regions.},
